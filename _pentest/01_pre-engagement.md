#### Security Testing
- it’s a process to evaluate security controls and objectives effectiveness.
- it’s a periodical process (Ex: based on compliance requirements) or any major changes happend to organization network.
- Vulnerability Assessment : Process of detection to find weaknesses(vulnerabilities)
- Penetration Testing : Exploiting detected vulnerabilites

#### Categories 
##### Black hat testing
- No prior information about target 
- Help to test incident response and how effectively detection and prevention working, blue team detection rate
##### White hat testing 
- Complete information about IP ranges, Scope and objectives
##### Grey Hat Testing 
- Combination of both white and black box assessment approach 
#### Types of Cyber Security Assessments 
- Vulnerability assessment
- Penetration Test
	- internal network
		- Testing internal resources/internal network and perimeter security defenses in practice 
		- Useful to evaluate insider threat attacks, lateral movement, etc 
	- external network
		- Testing external resources, cloud services, web services, application api calls, Stress testing and DDOS and DOS attacks 
		- Mostly like external attacker targeting company, testing how external vulnerabilities can be exploited.
		- Helps to find external vulnerabilities, evaluate external exploitation and potential damage that attacker can impact the business/data privacy.

	- physical 
	- cloud
	- social engineering (phishing and vishing)
- Security Audit
	- PCI
	- HIPPA
- Red Team Assessment 
- Standards and Frameworks
	-  NIST SP 800-115
 	-  CESG CHECK
 	-  CREST
	-  Tiger Scheme
 	-  The Cyber Scheme
	-  PCI DSS
 	-  PTES
	-  NSA IAM
	-  OSSTMM
	-  OWASP
- Risk Management
	- Identifying, evaluating, assessing and mitigating risk
	- VAPT comes handy for Risk identification, evalution and Assessment 

#### Teams
- Red Team : Perform black box approch to test security controls
- Blue Team : Defend the cyber attacks 
- Purple Team


#### Pentest Phases
##### Scoping/Planning
- Define Scope of the engagement 
- what to test
- Defining Rules of the Engagement 
- Number of ip's/ ip ranges , CIDRS
- Is any critical systems and third party services/systems
- what kind of test/assessment to run
- Is it onsite or offsite
- Timelines of assessment
- Reconnaissance
	- Active
	- Passive
- Enumeration 
- Scanning
- Exploitation
- Infitration and Exfiltration of Data
- Maintaing Undetectability
##### Reconnaissance / Information Gathering
- Active
- Passive
##### Scanning
##### Vulnerability Assessment and Theart Modeling
##### Exploitation/Post Exploitation 
##### Reporting/Documentation
##### cleaning 
- clean downloaded/executed payloads
- use unique names for payloads
- webshells, use strong passwords to access them

#### My approch 
- Having clear infromation and idea regarding client Needs, client organization model, business model, previous cyber attacks 
- Singned NDA, discussion on scope,  Point of Contact, knowing critical operations in environment
- prepare your tools and test them on enviroment (Simulate like client infrastructure), know what your doing. 
- running VAPT, analyzing and evaluating results with business risk score ( don't throw tool output on client) 
- Reporting and presentation to client
	- Vulnerabilities found
	- Exploits used
	- Privilege escalation 
	- Password policies (strength and reusability)
	- whcich compliance got impacted and which security policies need to enforce
	- Best Practices to implement 
	
#### Keywords
- Threat
- Risk
