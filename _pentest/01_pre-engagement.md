#### Security Testing
- Testing/checking security objectives and controllers by following certain standards and conditions 
- it’s a process to evaluate security control’s effectiveness
- it’s a periodical process (Ex: based on compliance requirements) or any major changes happend to organization network 
- Ex: penetration tester check which ports open and which services are running, is firewall controllers working effectively as expected, checking network segmentation in PCI environment

#### Scope
- Define Scope of the engagement 
	- what to test
    	- Defining Rules of the Engagement 
    	- Number of ip's/ ip ranges , CIDRS
#### Types
##### Internal 
- Testing internal resources/internal network and perimeter security defenses in practice 
- Useful to evaluate insider threat attacks, lateral movement, etc 
##### External 
- Testing external resources, cloud services, web services, application api calls, Stress testing and DDOS and DOS attacks 
- Mostly like external attacker targeting company, testing how external vulnerabilities can be exploited.
- Helps to find external vulnerabilities, evaluate external exploitation and potential damage that attacker can impact the business/data privacy. 
#### Categories 
##### Black hat testing
- No prior information about target 
- Help to test incident response and how effectively detection and prevention working, blue team detection rate
##### White hat testing 
- Complete information about IP ranges, Scope and objectives
##### Grey Hat Testing 
- Combination of both white and black box assessment approach 
#### Assessments 
- Vulnerability assessment : looking for weaknesses, unpatched services 
	- OSSTMM security assessment
	- ISSAF 
	- NIST (SP800-115)
	- scanners 
		- running Nessus or Open VAS
		- its suggestable to bound with two or three tools while doing Vulnerabilty Assessment
	- Vulnerabilites information
		- US national Vulnerabilty Database

- Penetration Test: exploiting vulnerabilities  Ex: Metasploit, Defan
	- Need to have written permission from the client
	- PTES (pentesting standards)

- Security Audit
	- PCI
	- HIPPA
	
#### Teams
- Red Team : Perform black box approch to test security controls
- Blue Team : Defend the cyber attacks 

#### Risk Management
- Identifying, evaluating, assessment and mitigating risk
- VAPT comes handy for Risk identification, evalution and Assessment 
##### Keywords
- Threat
- Risk 
- Vulnerability
- exploit 

#### Penetration Testing 
- Manual and automated approch to exploit the vulnerabilites
- invovles internal network, external(remote) network, wireless, physical, cloud and social engineering (phishing and vishing)
##### Phases
- Reconnaissance
	- Active
	- Passive
- Enumeration 
- Scanning
- Exploitation
- Infitration and Exfiltration of Data
- Maintaing Undetectability


#### My approch 
- I like to know/clear discussion regarding client Needs, client organization model, business model, previous cyber attacks 
- Singned NDA, discussion on scope,  Point of Contact, knowing critical operations in environment
- prepare your tools and test them on enviroment (Simulate like client infrastructure), know what your doing. 
- running VAPT, analyzing and evaluating results with business risk score ( don't throw tool output on client) 
- Reporting and presentation to client
